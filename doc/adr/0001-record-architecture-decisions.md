# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date 30 December 2025

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record architectural decisions about this project in a way that is both easy to write and easy to read.

## Decision

We will use Architectural Design Records as described in Michal Nygard's blog, [Documenting Architecture
Decisions][adr].

This approach conveniently captures relevant information, and lives close to the source code.

## Consequences

Future developers and stakeholders will be able to quickly find the rational for significant architectural and project
decisions.

Developers will need to be diligent about capturing major architectural decisions.

Opinionated scaffolding for polyglot projects.

## What is This?
`polyglot-forge` is a public monorepo containing project scaffolding for various programming languages and frameworks.
It provides a consistent structure, conventions, ADRs, and language-specific blueprints you can use in real projects.

Make starting and scaling multi-language projects boring (in the best way).

## Conventions
- Prefer *simple, composable* layouts over magic generators.
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- Document decisions in ADRs as soon as they matter.
